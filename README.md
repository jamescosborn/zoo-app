## Phase 2 -- Operation Manticore

I've been working here long enough to see that this zoo is quickly going out of business. We only have 3 animals, we're located under a bridge in a sketchy part of town, and maybe a dozen people visit us every day.

Here is my solution to bring in more paying visitors at a premium price point.

Let's tweak the regular zoo format to become a "Death Metal Zoo."

Visitors will no longer be paying to safely watch animals in enclosures, instead they will pay 4x as much to be hunted by those very same animals.

Picture it: you enter the zoo, and no staff are in sight. Then you see it--Marty is there, watching you, in the middle of the thoroughfare. Unleashed, he starts trotting and barking at you. The visitors will be thrilled, nay, ecstatic! It's like riding a roller coaster, but better!

Let me know if this all sounds acceptable. However, in anticipation of your undoubted approval of this amazing plan, I've taken the liberty of letting Marty out of his pen this morning, free to roam throughout the park. I also shared with him 4 rolls of Sweet Tarts, 2 boxes of Cinnabons, and a Rockstar energy drink to amp him up for hunting humans, so watch out!

Cheers,
James
